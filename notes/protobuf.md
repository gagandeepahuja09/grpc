Protobufs help with stub generation
* In a .proto file, the API contracts description are given.
* Server & client stubs are generated by:
    * Protocol buffer compiler ==> protoc.
    * gRPC plugins of each language.

Why gRPC uses protocol buffer?
* Human-readable Interface Definition Language(IDL)
* Has code generation support for multiple languages.
* Provides binary data representation:
    * Smaller size
    * Faster to transport
    * More efficient to serialize/deserialize.
* Strongly typed contract.
* Conventions for API evolution:
    * Backward & forward compatibility.
